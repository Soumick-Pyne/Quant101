I am storing every period's returns for each ticker in tickers_ret dictionary. The keys of this dictionary are the stocks and the values are lists of periodic return for each stock.

The list is populated using the below logic:

if there is no signal, the return of that period is 0

if there is an open buy position, the return of each period is (close_price of current period/close_price of previous period)-1

if there is an open sell position, the return of each period is (close_price of previous period/close_price of current period)-1

Calculating returns for periods in which new positions uses the same formula. My assumption is that if we get a signal at the end of a candle, we will be able to execute the trade at the closing price of that candle (very naive assumption). Therefore for a new buy or sell signal the formula above will remain the same.

Calculating returns for periods in which existing positions are closed is tricky. My assumption is that all existing positions will have a rolling stop loss equal to (close price - ATR). Therefore if the stop loss is triggered, you will exit at the above price. I use this price to calculate the return for that particular period.


Once the tickers_ret  dictionary is fully populated, I change this to a returns dataframe for KPI calculation.
